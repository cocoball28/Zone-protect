# Zone-protect

A protection plugin for Sponge designed to be flexible to suit the needs of the server.

Zone-Protect is a free and open source plugin for anyone to use and even contribute to.

## Supported Platforms

Currently we support the following

- [Sponge Vanilla](https://www.spongepowered.org/downloads/spongevanilla?minecraft=1.16.5&offset=0) API 8 (1.16)
- [Sponge Forge](https://www.spongepowered.org/downloads/spongeforge?minecraft=1.16.5&offset=0) API 8 (1.16)

And we plan on supporting more in the future.

Zone-Protect is designed to take advantage of modern code and will be updating with Sponge. Due to this we have a Java
version requirement of Java 16 at minimum and this will likely update as older Sponge versions are dropped from support.
