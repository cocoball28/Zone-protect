# As a None-Developer

Are you a admin of a server running Zone-protect or just a user of the plugin? and want to help out?

Well good news, you don't need to be a developer to help out.

**Got a feature you want in the plugin?**
> Then please submit a "issue" request for that feature [here](https://github.com/Zone-Protect/Zone-protect/issues/new/choose)

**Know the answer to one of
our [community questions](https://github.com/Zone-Protect/Zone-protect/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3Aquestion)
?**
> By all means, answer it and help out the community. Our developers can be very busy, so allowing them to focus on bringing new features in is always better.
> Even if your not 100% sure, helping someone look in the right direction is always a good thing.

**Someone submitted a [request](https://github.com/Zone-Protect/Zone-protect/issues) you really want?**
> Give it a thumbs up to show that there is demand for it. The more demand there is for something, the more likely the feature will be worked on

# As a Developer

We are always looking for developers from the experienced to the novice, we welcome all.

As a developer wanting to have your code in the zones-protect plugin, take a look at
our [Issue Board](https://github.com/Zone-Protect/Zone-protect/issues)
> If you see something you like the look of, then by all means assign yourself to it (comment first and then it will allow you to assign yourself). Then fork the project, make your modifications and then submit a PR. Dont know how to do that? Take a look below! ;)
> If there isnt a issue you see then take a look at the none developer (they apply to you too)

## Creating a PR

Take a look at our WIKI for [developer setup](https://github.com/Zone-Protect/Zone-protect/wiki/Developer-Setup). It has
its own contiribution section that covers forking, pring, etc.
